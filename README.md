Client and Software requirement:
The client "The Gaming Room" task was to develop a web-based version of their existing game "Draw it, or Lose it". The game was to be accessible across multiple platforms and support multiplayer function with unique team names and players.

Strength of documentation:
The document outlines the client's requirements, design constraints, system architecture, evaluation and recommendations on how the program should be created. It provides detailed descriptions of the above mentioned to ensure a comprehensive understanding of the project scope, objectives, and how to proceed according to the client's provided wants.

Beneficial process of design:
The document facilitated a structured approach to software development. It conceptualizes the system architecture, identifying key components and considerations to incorporate a wide range of platforms. By addressing each aspect in a systematic approach of software design, it ensures alignment with client expectations and industry best practices.

Area for revision:
One area of revision could include sample illustrations to visually appeal to the client. This can include diagrams, flowcharts, dataflows and potential interactions between components. This would give a non-IT savvy individual a more user-friendly approach.

User needs implementation:
Considering the user needs is paramount in software design. By understanding their preferences, the software can be tailored to appeal to their needs and own expectations. This enhances usability and drives engagement with the end user. Ultimately, this leads to a intuitive, user-friendly and becomes a successful outcome not only for the user, but also the client.

Approach to designing software:
In designing the software, Employing a systematic approach that involved analyzing requirements, conceptualizing the system architecture, and evaluating platform specific considerations gives a preview of how the end-goal would be achieved. Utilizing techniques such as modeling, evaluation matrices ensures a comprehensive and structured design process. Moving forward, it would be emphasized to continued collaborations, refinement with users and client to deliver an impactful solution to a finished product.
